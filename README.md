# How to start

This package includes scripts to download the pre-trained model from huggingface, and convert the model to GGUF format as well.

Therefore, you are required to install huggingface-cli and log in with a huggingface account.

To start building the models, run the following command.

```
yarn make_convertor  # Build the model convertor
yarn download  # Download models from huggingface
yarn convert  # Convert the models to GGUF format
```
